## Description
> A minimalistic mock restaurant page.

## Learnings
1. Understanding package managers and module bundlers.
2. Understadning ES6 modules.
3. Using DOM manipulation to generate the whole website.

## Technologies used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. vanillaJS
4. Webpack
5. NPM 

## Challenges I faced
1. Generating the markup using JS was a bit confusing at first.
2. Coming up with the design and choosing the theme.
3. Using webpack. I still don't have the hang of it, I looked up their official docs to get going.

## Room for improvement
1. Upgrading the UI for the food item cards.
2. Implementing adding to cart and checkout functionality.
3. Adding in payment functionality.
4. Add the google map for the restaurant.
5. Improving the content for the about and contact page.
